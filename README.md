üöÄ Features

Augmented Reality Navigation

Real-time AR overlays with directional arrows.

Supports multi-floor navigation: if a POI is on another floor, SmartCompass guides users to the nearest elevator/stairs, switches the floor scene, and continues navigation.

Visual Positioning System (VPS)

Marker and environment-based tracking for accurate positioning indoors.

Dynamic path recalculation when users deviate from the route.

Persuasive Technology Integration

Uses strategies like reminders, rewards, personalization, and social influence to make navigation engaging.

Encourages exploration of POIs (e.g., libraries, labs, student services) with gamified nudges.

AI Personalization

Tracks frequently visited areas, time spent, and time-of-day patterns.

Recommends optimized routes and suggests POIs based on user habits.

Adapts difficulty and level of guidance for first-time vs. experienced users.

Data Tracking & Analytics

Connected to MongoDB Realm to log:

Places visited

Time spent per POI

Distance walked

Supports visual history stats:

Daily/weekly trends

Total distance covered

Number of POIs visited

Engagement Dashboard (Future)

Displays progress charts, milestones, and streaks.

Persuasive feedback loops to keep users active.

üèõ Use Case

SmartCompass is being developed for Dalhousie University buildings, but the framework can be adapted to malls, hospitals, airports, or corporate campuses.
